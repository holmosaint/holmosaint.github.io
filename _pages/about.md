I'm Kaiwen Sheng, currently a research assistant at UCL working with Dr. Brendan Bicknell and Prof. Michael Häusser. Previously, I got my Master's degree in neuroscience from UCL, supervised by Dr. Brendan Bicknell and Prof. Michael Häusser, and obtained my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2020, supervised by Dr. Kai Du and Prof. Tiejun Huang. My research interests lie in dendritic computation, neural networks and neural data analysis.
