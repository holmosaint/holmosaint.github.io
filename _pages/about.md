I'm Kaiwen Sheng, currently an MRes student in neuroscience at University College London(UCL). I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2020 and took a gap year in BAAI as a software development engineer. My research interests lie in developing machine learning tools for neuroscience and computations in ion channels and synapses.
